<h1>Model Training</h1>
The teacher models are trained using <b>teacher_training.py</b>.  
Once the teacher models are trained, the student model can be trained using <b>knowledge_distillation_training.py</b>.  

<h1>Pre-trained Model</h1>
We use RegNet as the pre-trained model.  
The weights can be downloaded from this repository:  https://github.com/biyoml/TF2-Pretrained-RegNets
